<h1>This game is called Apocalypse Survivor now, and is on the appstore!</h1>

This game is built off of SpriteKit technology. The goal of the game is to not get infected by a zombie, which occurs if the zombie touches your character. Zombies will regularly spawn and chase after you, and if to zombies collide, they will get merge and become bigger in size. Your goal is to stay alive as long as possible, which means to get as high of a score as possible, and you are given a couple ways to do that. First, you can just outmanuever the zombies and you are given a boost to help you zoom forward. Second, you are given a gun, and ammo will spawn around the map. You can pick up the ammo and shoot it at the zombies. Only the smallest zombie size will die when hit by a bullet, which means that he bigger merged zombies will only decrease in size when hit by a bullet, so some zombies will reuqire multiple shots to kill. Killing a zombie will award you points to your score. Good luck, and don't get infected!
